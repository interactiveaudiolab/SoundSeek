# SoundSeek
SoundSeek is a query by example tool for exploring sound libraries. Unlike most tools for managing sound libraries, which organize sounds using text tags, SoundSeek organizes sounds using a handpicked set of timbral features. The interactive sound map then allows users to explore their library of sounds in a fun and intuitive way.
